They say you are what you eat; The same applies to (micro)services: You are the interface that you provide; New age architectures have resulted in an explosion of interface endpoints that require management of cross cutting concerns -- security, traffic management, monitoring and much more. The quality of your APIs (managed like a product), in conjunction with the aforementioned concerns is a defining measure of how robust your platform architecture is. Not surprisingly, API management also sits at the ingress point of all FaaS and a whole host of related concerns.

We assist customers to manage API platform & product concerns in the context of modern software architecture and buildig a sustainable digital ecosystem that caters to developers.
