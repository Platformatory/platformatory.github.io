Eventception is a platform to synthesize events from API transactions for building event driven systems. It integrates directly with most API platforms, gateways and proxies in near real time and allows you to synthesize API logs into self-evident events using an interactive model or declarative annotations embedded directly in your interface description, such as in your OpenAPI3 spec.
