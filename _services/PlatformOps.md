For many years, operations was a second class citizen of the engineering lifecycle. In 2021, DevSecOps & Site Reliability Engineering are mainstream and no longer the novel way to operate. If your organization has a linear or sub-linear relationship between the number of members in your IT/DevOps/Security team and the number of cloud resources or applications you operate, consider you need to bring in a freah breath of air into the way you operate.

We help customers industrialize cloud native application & platform operations

- <span class="icon-serv"><img src="../images/survey-icon.png" /></span>Baselining SLOs: Current & desired state of your application, measured against the golden signals (latency, traffic, error rate & saturation) 
- <span class="icon-serv"><img src="../images/survey-icon.png" /></span>Scaling & economics: The cloud can hyperscale, but this isn't a free lunch. Architecture of scale is constrained by costs (or how not to let the cloud burn your pocket)
- <span class="icon-serv"><img src="../images/survey-icon.png" /></span>Improving observability: What you can't observe, you cannot diagnose, debug or measure. Improve traceability of problems both before and after they occur
- <span class="icon-serv"><img src="../images/survey-icon.png" /></span>SecOps: Cloud & data security is a paramount concern. We live in a zero-trust world and security should be by design, not a bolt-on.
