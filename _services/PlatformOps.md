For many years, operations was a low priority in the engineering lifecycle. In 2021, DevSecOps & Site Reliability Engineering are mainstream and no longer the novel way to operate. Is your organization's IT/DevOps/Security headcount growing along with the number of cloud resources or applications ? You may need to consider a different approach to deal with this situation.

We help customers industrialize cloud native application & platform operations.

- <span class="icon-serv"><img src="../images/icons/slo.svg" /></span>**Baselining SLOs**: Current & desired state of your application, measured against the golden signals (latency, traffic, error rate & saturation) 
- <span class="icon-serv"><img src="../images/icons/scaling.svg" /></span>**Scaling & economics**: The cloud can hyperscale, but this isn't a free lunch. Architecture of scale is constrained by costs (or how not to let the cloud burn your pocket)
- <span class="icon-serv"><img src="../images/icons/monitoring.svg" /></span>**Improving observability**: What you can't observe, you cannot diagnose, debug or measure. Improve traceability of problems both before and after they occur
- <span class="icon-serv"><img src="../images/icons/secops.svg" /></span>**SecOps**: Cloud & data security is a paramount concern. We live in a zero-trust world and security should be by design, not a bolt-on.
