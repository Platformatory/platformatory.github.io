Changing behaviour is hard. Part & parcel of adopting a new platform or technology (particularly in central IT) is finding adoption while managing risk. This is literally every CTIO's dilemma. While there is no silver bullet to solve this, incentivizing adoption through demonstration of value, assured support & expert assistance pays off eventually towards creating an agile culture that embraces change. 

We partner towards being that team that facilitates internal dev rel and alignment.
