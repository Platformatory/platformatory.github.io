Cloud infrastructure management is at the very base of platform operations. Today, infrastructure is an increasingly complex array of managed platform services with varying choices and differentiation across cloud providers. Kubernetes is a great leveler, but platform teams must own cross-cloud, multi-platform Infrastructure as Code, with a GitOps model in order to run sustainably. Our offering is an opportunity for the platform teams to leapfrog maturity and operate infrastructure at optimal cost across all major public cloud providers.
