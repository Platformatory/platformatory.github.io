A strong platform foundation is a prerequsite for rolling out digital products and designning customer experiences.It also has to provide strong governance and security by design. This boils down to 5 things:

- A hybrid cloud foundation to operate across hyperscalers and private cloud or on-premise
- Continuous delivery infrastructure: Deliver faster & deliver better
- Modern integration: ESB & Legacy middleware are passe. Move to a future of event driven architecture
- Everything is a service: APIs provide abstraction & lifecycle management
- Polyglot data persistence & application runtime: Run any programming language and use any database  

Specifically, we help deliver "fast start" accelerators involving best in breed technology choices based on our experience.
