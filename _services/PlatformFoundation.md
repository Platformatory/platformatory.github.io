A strong platform foundation not only provides a launchpad for rolling out digital products & customer experiences, but also provides strong governance & security by design. This boils down to 5 things:

1. A hybrid cloud foundation to operate across hyperscalers and private cloud or on-premise
2. Continuous delivery infrastructure: Deliver faster & deliver better
3. Modern integration: ESB & Legacy middleware are passe. Move to a future of event driven architecture
4. Everything is a service: APIs provide abstraction & lifecycle management
5. Polyglot data persistence & application runtime: Run any programming language and use any database  

Specifically, we help deliver "fast start" accelerators involving opinionated but best in breed tech choices:

- <span class="icon-serv"><img src="../images/icons/cloudfoundation.svg" /></span>Kubernetes as a unified cloud native operating model: Clusters secured and CIS benchmarked for production usage. Delivered as Terraform & ansible scripts with full lifecycle monitoring via Prometheus, Grafana (or your existing tooling)
- <span class="icon-serv"><img src="../images/icons/pipelines.svg" /></span>Spinnaker, Tekton pipelines as code. Built to suit your stack and deployment cadence
- <span class="icon-serv"><img src="../images/icons/hub.svg" /></span>Kafka or NATS as a cloud native event bus: Stream evemts, data & build reactive architectures
- <span class="icon-serv"><img src="../images/icons/operators.svg" /></span>Kubernetes operators & service brokers to run almost any SQL, No-SQL datastore
- <span class="icon-serv"><img src="../images/icons/gateway.svg" /></span>Kong as a unified API Gateway & service control: Centralized observability, security & lfiecycle management of APIs
