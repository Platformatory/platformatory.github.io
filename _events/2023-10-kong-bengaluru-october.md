### Talks

**CRED's Implementation of CI/CD for Managing Kong Configurations**

_Speaker:_ Sreekumar, CRED

About the talk: In this presentation, we'll explain how we started using Kong decK to manage Kong route and plugin configurations, the problems we faced, and how we solved them.

**Kong: Product Roadmap**

_Speaker:_ Marco Palladino, CTO & Co-Founder, Kong

About the talk: Hear from the CTO of Kong about the future of the product. History of Kong and the way ahead, product map for the next year. This will be followed by a Fireside chat with Marco about his journey with Kong.

**Verifone’s Journey towards spec-first approach for Kong configurations and leveraging Kong insomnia to generate vendor agnostic solution**

_Speaker:_ Prema Namasivayam, Satyajit Sial, Verifone

About the talk: - Verifone’s cloud migration project requires Kong-ingress controller which in turn requires ingress rules to be added for Kong ingress controller. Our earlier approach with decK configs were not allowing us to migrate to ingress rules easily. Hence, we started our journey towards spec-first approach where insocli helps us to generate ingress rules for Kong Ingress Controller and decK configs for Kong Gateway to solve all our technological needs. We will talk about how to define Open API specs to define kong configs for service, route,upstreams, targets, kong plugins, custom plugins and also how to release specs with varying parameters for every environment. We will be demonstrating how Kong insomnia helps in achieving the below flow.

**Heracles: Empowering with Kong. Building a robust traffic and observability platform for seamless performance and insights**

_Speaker:_ Mayank Verma, Nishant Hooda, Zeta

About the talk: - Give overview of Heracles platform traffic and Observability capabilities build on top of Kong.
