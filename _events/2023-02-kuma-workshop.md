Join us in our first in-person hands-on workshop in Bengaluru as we learn about Service Mesh and Kong's open source implementation - Kuma. As usual, we'll have some great networking opportunities, swag and some tasty snacks!

Kuma is an open source multi-zone service mesh for containers, Kubernetes and VMs. It is built with Envoy as a proxy and is a CNCF Sandbox project. During the workshop, we'll introduce the concept of service mesh and help you get started with Kuma in a hands-on practical session. The workshop is intended for people with various experiences and backgrounds but are new to Kuma and the world of service meshes.
