### Talks

- **Beyond Tiered Storage: Serverless Kafka with No Local Disks**

_Speaker:_ **Richard Artoul, Co-Founder @ WarpStream Labs**

_About the talk:_ Separation of compute and storage has become the de-facto standard in the data industry for batch processing.
The addition of tiered storage to open source Apache Kafka is the first step in bringing true separation of compute and storage to the streaming world.
In this talk, we'll discuss in technical detail how to take the concept of tiered storage to its logical extreme by building an Apache Kafka protocol compatible system that has zero local disks.
Eliminating all local disks in the system requires not only separating storage from compute, but also separating data from metadata. This is a monumental task that requires reimagining Kafka's architecture from the ground up, but the benefits are worth it.
This approach enables a stateless, elastic, and serverless deployment model that minimizes operational overhead and also drives inter-zone networking costs to almost zero.

- **Real-Time Predictions with Machine Learning & Redpanda Streaming Data Transforms**

_Speaker:_ **Christina Lin, Developer Advocate, Redpanda**

_About the talk:_  In this session, we'll address how to simplify data structures in AI applications, emphasizing the importance of not overcomplicating data architecture while constructing stateless pipelines for real-time analytics.<br>
We'll cover the creation of an efficient data platform using Redpanda data transforms powered by WebAssembly (WASM), particularly tailored for dynamic industries (we will use food delivery as an example). We'll show how to simplify your data stack and demonstrate with a lab how complex data structures often hinder the agility and performance of AI systems. The lab will focus on stateless pipelines, where each data item is processed independently, and showcases how to build scalable and robust AI applications without the burden of cumbersome data frameworks. Attendees will see how Redpanda's integration facilitates seamless real-time data processing and instant transformations that are crucial to responsive and accurate AI-driven predictions.<br>
We will cover:<br>
• Streamlined data ingestion and transformation<br>
• Real-time machine learning<br>
• Simplified infrastructure setup<br>
Participants will learn how to avoid common pitfalls associated with complex data structures and data stacks, and will gain insights into creating more effective, agile, and responsive applications – especially for AI. The methodologies are applicable across various industries and use cases.

- **Stream Processing in SQL: One Approach**

_Speaker:_ **Noel Kwan, Software Engineer at RisingWave Labs**

_About the talk:_  In this talk, Noel will show you how to process real-time streaming data using SQL in RisingWave, which is fully wire compatible with PostgreSQL. He will use the real-world example (NYC Taxi dataset) to explain stateless computation, stateful computation, data ingestion and delivery, among others.

- **Apache Hudi 1.0 preview: A database experience on the data lake**

_Speaker:_ **Onehouse** (TBA)
