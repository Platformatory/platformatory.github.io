### Talks

- **Optimizing Real-Time Analytics: Strategies for Optimizing high concurrency real time analytics using Apache Kafka and Apache Druid**

_Speaker:_ **Tijo Thomas, Manager, Solutions Architect @ Imply**

_About the talk:_ We will delve into Apache Druid's capabilities as a real-time analytical database optimized for event-driven data and large-scale queries. We will discuss Druid's data storage and indexing strategies, which allow for fast data ingestion and query responses, essential for real-time analytics.

The core of the talk will focus on tuning and optimization strategies for both Kafka and Druid. This includes configuring Kafka producers and consumers for maximum efficiency, understanding and applying Druid's indexing schemes, and tuning Druid's query performance. We will also discuss how to effectively manage and scale the Kafka-Druid pipeline to handle increasing volumes of data.

- **Mq (Queuing Abstraction at Meesho for Scalable and Efficient Communication)**

_Speaker:_ **Ramiz Mehran, Software Architect at Meesho**

_About the talk:_ We'll explore the challenges of tightly coupled messaging queues and the financial and operational inefficiencies they introduce, such as over-provisioning and migration headaches. We'll introduce MQ Abstraction as a solution that decouples application code from specific messaging infrastructures, enabling seamless interaction and standardizing configurations for optimal performance. Through a quick overview of its architecture and benefits, we'll discuss how MQ Abstraction simplifies messaging queue interactions, promotes scalability, and reduces costs.

- **Solving for Real-time in modern ecommerce: A primer on challenges, opportunities and solutions**

_Speaker:_ **Ashwin Venkatesan, Platform Engineer @ Platformatory.io**

_About the talk:_ Customer experience is the real driver of innovation. And there's no harder challenge for CX than in the face of large scale ecommerce. This talk focuses on where streaming fits in, along with our experiential tidbits of working with over half a dozen top retailers. We will specifically talk through<br>
• Inventory Awareness (and why real-time inventory is crucial)<br>
• How dynamic pricing is the final frontier of personalization<br>
• Optimizing costs of commerce: advertising, shipping and with predictive insights on fresh data trends
