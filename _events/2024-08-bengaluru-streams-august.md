### Talks

- **Transforming Your APIs Into Business Gold – Architecting a Real-Time API Usage Analytics Platform**

_Speaker:_ **Dunith Danushka, Developer Advocate at Redpanda**

_About the talk:_ 
In today's hyper-connected digital landscape, real-time API usage analysis and billing have become paramount. With the proliferation of APIs at the heart of modern applications and services, gaining real-time insights into their use is often mission-critical as it depends on critical factors such as latency, throughput, freshness, and the correctness of generated insights.
This talk discusses the architecture of a real-time API usage analytics system composed of Redpanda, Apache Flink, and Apache Pinot. Redpanda, as a scalable streaming data platform, enables high-volume, low-latency API volume data ingestion from API gateways in real time. The ingested data is streamed through Flink for streaming ETL, enabling operations like joins, aggregations, and transformations, feeding the final output of the pipeline to Apache Pinot for serving analytics at scale. In addition to that, we will use Flink for rate-limiting incoming API requests.
Having such a system enables businesses to make informed, agile decisions, addressing performance bottlenecks, security threats, and resource allocation issues in the API infrastructure promptly. Also, it ensures seamless user experiences by identifying usage patterns, issues, and opportunities as they occur, proactively enhancing the quality of your product.
Whether you're a data engineer, an application developer, or an architect, this talk promises to equip you with the knowledge and tools to build a real-time analytics solution that empowers your organization with the insights it needs to stay ahead in a data-driven world.

- **Unified access layer for Kafka resources**

_Speaker:_ **Avinash Upadhyaya and Pavan Keshavamurthy, Platformatory**

_About the talk:_ As the adoption of Kafka increases in an organization, a common pattern is the adoption of Platform Engineering with a cental team managing Kafka clusters. However, in order to truly decouple the developers from managing Kafka clusters, a common access layer for the Kafka clusters might be necessary for migration, centrally managing authentication & authorization, DR and enforcing best practices & optimizations. In this talk, we will explore options for building a Kafka platform with an unified access layer for developers using Kafka.
