### Talks

**Powering Observability using Kafka, Druid & Grafana**

_Speaker:_ Mohammad Ghazanfar, Senior Software Engineer II, Confluent

About the talk: Unleash the Power of Kafka to solve Observability!

Explore a real-world Kafka use-case in how Confluent solved Observability using Kafka, Druid & Grafana. Discover how Kafka's distributed streaming platform acts as the backbone for real-time data processing and event streaming, ensuring data integrity and high throughput. Understand how Kafka's data streaming integrates seamlessly with Druid and Grafana to provide actionable insights, alerting and enhanced system monitoring. Learn how Druid accelerates data access and facilitates real-time analysis for monitoring and decision-making. Finally get to see how Grafana empowers users to transform raw data into meaningful visualizations and enables monitoring and alerting.

Join us to unravel the transformative potential of Kafka, Druid and Grafana in the realm of observability.

**A Primer Towards Tunning Kafka on Top of Kubernetes**

_Speaker:_ Avinash Upadhyaya, Platform Engineer at Platformatory and Ashwin Venkatesan, Platform Engineer at Platformatory

About the talk: This talk will provide an introduction to concerns around running Apache Kafka on top of K8S and the operator pattern. It will cover a comparative view of operators available as well as experiential guidance around operations at scale

**Eventing Aside: A pattern towards unobstrusive eventing with RESTFul services**

_Speaker:_ Pavan Keshavamurthy, CTO & Co-founder @ Platformatory.io

About the talk: This talk will explore a pattern that can enable almost any RESTful service (including legacy) into an event-source, as long as it is fronted by an API gateway. We will also talk through implications for event-sourcing, CQRS and general transaction processing. We will conclude with a demo that leverages Kong - a popular open source API gateway and Kafka
