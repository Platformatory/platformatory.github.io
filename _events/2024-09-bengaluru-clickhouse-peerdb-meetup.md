### Talks

- **ClickHouse + PeerDB: The Tale that Connects Us**

_Speaker:_ **Sai Srirampur and PeerDB team**

_About the talk:_ PeerDB makes it fast and simple to replicate data from Postgres to ClickHouse. It already supports multiple production customers moving billions of rows and terabytes of data from their Postgres databases to ClickHouse for real-time analytics.

In this talk, we will delve into the internals of how PeerDB works. We will cover state-of-the-art optimizations that enable 10x faster replication, incl. features such as parallel snapshotting to move TBs of data in hours vs days; continuous flushing of the replication slot; ReplacingMerge to support data modification workloads; and so on. We will also show an interactive demo of PeerDB in action.

As a special topic, we’ll discuss how we built an enterprise-grade infra SaaS offering (PeerDB Cloud) in ~6 months. It is already replicating over a petabyte of data from Postgres. We’ll also explain how we’re integrating it with ClickPipes, the native ingestion service for ClickHouse.
