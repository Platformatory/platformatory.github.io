Modernization is a commitment towards the perpetual evolution of your software stack to suit the changing needs of business. We believe modernization can be business centric with a measure RoI (in other words, not technology for the sake of technology);

In pratice, most modernization initiatives tend to be focused only on the application stack and tactical around the possibilities the cloud can offer. Our experience dicatates that customers who achieve positive outcomes in modernizing their tech estate do a few things right.

1. Product orientation (in contrast to project or specialized silos): This has impacts across people, processes, tooling & culture
2. Domain driven design: Baking a self-evident business architecture layer into your product
3. Engineering excellence: Software defined everything backed by continous delivery & experimentation infrastructure
4. Clear KPIs of impact to business: Make money, save money or reduce risk
