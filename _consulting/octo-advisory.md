Life is hard for SaaS founders, but particularly for business founders. Finding tech co-founders is harder than dating. Hiring a CTO is a $400K venture (give or take equity), plus the effort of actually convincing someone to join. Our offering provides the ability to leverage such a senior technocrat as a shared resource when you need to be conservative. This model comes with skin in the game for both parties, while enabling you to plan eventual succession to your own tech team.
