# Platform & Product Engineering Boutique

Our mission is to build a creatively destructive software company with a global footprint of artisanal practitioners.

One, solve customer problems.
Two, deal with complexity.
Three, fall in love with technology (again)

What sets us apart?

* Intersectional expertise is a super power
* Teaching, practicing, sharing is a value
* Keep it flat. Stay lean, stay young


If you're a senior technologist with a passion for platform engineering, dev(sec)ops, site reliability engineering or related disciplines, we may be looking out for you. We have global full-time & contract roles open. Get in touch with us and we'll talk.
