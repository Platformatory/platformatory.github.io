# Culture lies in the code

We're a niche software consultancy building a global footprint. Our mission is to drive meaningful change at the heart of enterprise digital transformation initiatives.

What sets us apart?

1. Open Source & Open Standards: We strongly believe OSS & community driven innovation levels the playing field between big tech & rest of the world. Most of the individual contributors to Platformatory are contributors to various OSS projects.

2. Breadth, Depth: We aren't talking graph traversal, but the dilemma between software consulting companies that are generic SIs/consultants vs those that specialize in tools. At Platformatory, we strike a balance. Most of us are polyglot programmers with diverse industry, domain awareness & background in technology consulting.

3. Operate as a lean, agile collective: deliver incremental changes and work as an extension of customer teams. We're NOT into building pyramid shaped teams. Two pizza rule applies.

If you're a senior technologist with a passion for platform engineering, dev(sec)ops, site reliability engineering or related disciplines, we may be looking out for you. We have global full-time & contract roles open. Get in touch with us and we'll talk.
