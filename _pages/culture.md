# Creative Destruction in Software Engineering

## Our mission is to build a culture-heavy, global company that can solve customer problems with a level of engineering rigour that is unmatched in the consulting industry.

  <!-- A few things set us apart. -->

1. ### Intersectional expertise is a super power

   - Being T-shaped around the flux of evolving technologies is extremely rare and allows us to deliver orders of magnitude more value.

2. ### Teaching, practicing, sharing

   - Being a 100% practitioner driven setup, allows us to build highly artisanal guilds with real mastery over craft. Teaching (the community) and sharing (OSS/libre) reinforces this culture.

3. ### Seek simplicty & elegance, relentlessly

   - Complexity is a disease. We (often) operate in a contrasting world of super-reductionist concretions and needless abstractions. Navigating this requires a principled approach, while understanding boundaries of the domain.

4. ### Keep it flat. Stay lean, stay young

   - No delusions of building or scaling factories. No bulking & cutting cycles. A pursuit of achieving the highest level of skill attainable in a given context.
